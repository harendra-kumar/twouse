# Introduction #

Existing approaches for querying OWL DL do either only operate on
syntactic constructs without taking into account the semantics of OWL or do
only have a restricted access to the T-Box. We present SAIQL, the novel Schema
And Instance Query Language for OWL DL, that is well suited for ontology
extraction. We describe its syntax and explain a basic evaluation strategy.
